      question: 'What is Self-Exclusion?',
      answer: 'Self-exclusion is a voluntary program that allows individuals to restrict their access to gambling services for a specified period. This tool is designed to help players manage their gambling behavior by providing a break from gambling activities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How Self-Exclusion Works',
      answer: '1. Voluntary Participation:\n• Players can choose to self-exclude from our platform at any time.\n\n• The decision to self-exclude is entirely voluntary and can be initiated by the player through their account settings or by contacting customer liaison officer at compliance@Drifbet.com\n\n2. Duration of Self-Exclusion:\n• Players can select the duration of their self-exclusion period, which may range from a few days, month to several years, depending on their needs.\n\n• The decision to self-exclude is entirely voluntary and can be initiated by the player through their account settings or by contacting customer liaison officer at compliance@Drifbet.com\n\n3. Account Restrictions:\n• During the self-exclusion period, the player\'s account will be suspended, preventing access to gambling activities.\n\n• Players will not receive any promotional materials or communications related to gambling during this time.\n\n4. Reactivation Process:\n• After the self-exclusion period ends, players must contact the customer liaison officer at compliance@Drifbet.com to reactivate their account.\n\n• A cooling-off period may be applied before the account is fully reactivated to ensure the player is ready to return to gambling.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Support and Resources',
      answer: '1. Access to Support Services:\n• We provide information and links to professional support services and helplines for players seeking help with gambling-related issues.\n\n• Our customer support team is available to assist players in finding the resources they need.\n\n2.

    },
    {
      question: 'Monitoring and Compliance',
      answer: '1. System Integration:\n• Our systems are designed to enforce self-exclusion effectively, ensuring that excluded players cannot access their accounts or create new ones.\n\n• We regularly review our self-exclusion processes to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.\n\n2. Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies:\n• We work closely with regulatory bodies to ensure our self-exclusion policies meet all legal requirements.\n\n• Our commitment to responsible gambling includes regular audits and updates to our self-exclusion procedures.',
